# Task List: Process Automation with AI App

This task list tracks progress on implementing the PRD: Process Automation with AI App (rules/0001-prd-process-automation-with-ai.md).

## Key Principles

- Work on **one sub-task at a time**; request user permission to proceed.
- Mark sub-tasks as `[x]` upon completion.
- When all sub-tasks under a parent task are complete and tests pass: stage, commit, and mark parent as `[x]`.
- Pause after each sub-task for approval.
- Update "Relevant Files" section as files are created/modified.
