# Product Requirements Document (PRD): Process Automation with AI App

## Introduction/Overview

The Process Automation with AI app is designed to educate clients on how to automate business processes using technologies such as AI, robotics, NoCode, LowCode, and programming. Unlike systems that require consultant intermediaries, this app empowers end clients to directly explore and visualize automation solutions for their specific process challenges. The app addresses the issue of manual process inefficiencies by providing tools for querying recommendations, drawing process flows, accessing case studies, and simulating automation outcomes, enabling clients to understand and implement automation without external help.

## Goals

- Empower end clients to independently explore automation options for their business processes.
- Provide actionable recommendations combining AI, robotics, NoCode/LowCode, and programming solutions.
- Enable visual process mapping and simulation to demonstrate automation benefits.
- Build a searchable repository of anonymized case studies for real-world examples.
- Achieve measurable ROI by reducing time for process automation implementation relative to initial setup costs.

## User Stories

- As an end client, I want to enter a problem statement so that the app will generate an automation solution for my specific problem.
- As an end client, I want to draw a process flow on a canvas so that I can visualize and annotate how to automate each step.
- As an end client, I want to search a library of case studies so that I can find examples of successful automations in my industry.
- As an end client, I want to run simulations on proposed automations so that I can evaluate "what-if" scenarios and see potential efficiency gains.

## Functional Requirements

1. The system must allow users to submit process-related questions or descriptions to receive tailored automation recommendations.
2. The system must provide a drag-and-drop canvas for creating and annotating process flow diagrams.
3. The system must include a searchable database of anonymized case studies, categorized by industry, process type, and automation method.
4. The system must support virtual simulations where users can input process data and test automation scenarios.
5. The system must allow users to export process flows, case studies, and simulation results as PDFs or other formats.
6. The system must support user management, including login, team assignments, and sharing of workflows.
7. The system must offer a guest login mode that allows access to features but restricts saving data and backend usage.
8. The system must integrate with external tools via an integration hub for data retrieval and contextual recommendations.

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- The app will not provide direct implementation services or deploy automations on behalf of the user.
- The app will not manage live client data or systems; all interactions are for simulation and recommendation purposes only.
- The app will not include advanced collaboration features beyond team sharing and canvas co-editing.

## Design Considerations (Optional)

The UI should be intuitive and accessible, built with React and Tailwind CSS for responsive design. The canvas should integrate Draw.io or similar for process mapping. Mockups should emphasize simplicity to allow non-technical users to navigate features easily.

## Technical Considerations (Optional)

- Use OpenAI (via Open Router) for AI-powered recommendations.
- Host on Firebase with Firebase Functions for backend and Firestore as NoSQL DB.
- Implement authentication via email or Google accounts.
- Ensure unit tests run automatically on every build for code reliability.
- Canvas data should be saved in JSON format in Firestore for persistence and transfer between features.

## Success Metrics

- Achieve a positive ROI where time savings from process automations implemented via the app exceed the time invested in initial setup and learning.
- User engagement measured by frequency of feature usage (questions asked, canvases created, case studies searched, simulations run).
- Reduction in perceived complexity of automation adoption, tracked via user feedback surveys.
- Increase in successful automation implementations reported through optional user-contributed case studies.

## Open Questions

- How will the app handle varying levels of user technical expertise, especially for interpreting AI recommendations?
- What specific data inputs are required for simulations to ensure accurate "what-if" scenarios?
- How can the case study library ensure diversity and relevance across different industries and process types?
